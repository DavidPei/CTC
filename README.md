Code the Change assignments and projects

From http://berkeley.codethechange.org/about :

"Code the Change is an organization that empowers computer scientists to use their technical skills for social good through non-profit projects.

The Berkeley chapter consists of two divisions. Our DeCal program is intended for students with less experience in computer science; it offers them a chance to learn web development while working on a project for a nonprofit organization. Our other division is comprised of project teams, which work on more challenging projects for nonprofits. Our members are comprised of Cal students with a passion for both technology and the social sector. We offer a unique opportunity to improve your technical abilities and form meaningful relationships with members who share similar interests.

To learn more about the Stanford chapter and Code the Change as a national organization, please visit codethechange.org

If you represent a nonprofit organization and are interested in our technical services, please email us at berkeley@codethechange.org."
